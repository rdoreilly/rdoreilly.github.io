                p In e-health, my research addresses the challenges of analysing physiological data and biomedical images. I have developed methods to extract actionable insights from complex datasets, leveraging machine learning and distributed systems to support clinical decision-making. My work with biomedical image analysis includes enhancing dataset diversity using GANs, improving diagnostic accuracy. I also focus on knowledge discovery, integrating domain expertise with AI to uncover patterns in physiological data, such as stress indicators or cardiac anomalies, driving personalised healthcare advancements.
