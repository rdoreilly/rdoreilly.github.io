<h1>About</h1>


<p>Dr Ruairí O'Reilly is an academic in the Department of Computer Science at Cork Institute of Technology. Ruairí graduated with a BSc in Computer Science (2008) and a PhD in Computer Science (2015) from University College Cork. Dr O'Reilly's research focus is on artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, distributed systems, data analytics and affective computing.</p>

<p>The application of artificial intelligence is of particular interest. Currently, Dr O'Reilly is investigating the development, evaluation and validation of machine learning approaches in a clinical setting. Dr O'Reilly has carried out significant work in the development of distributed architectures for the monitoring and analysis of time series data as applied to healthcare. This has resulted in the deployment of remote health solutions integrating e-health, automated analysis and decision support systems.</p>

<h2>Current Teaching </h2>
<p>Currently I lecture two subjects, Knowledge Representation, a core module delivered as part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Data Visualisation, a 4th year elective to BSc Computer Science undergraduates.</p>
